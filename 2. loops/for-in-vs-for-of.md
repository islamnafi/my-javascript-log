# Difference Between `for...in` and `for...of`

## `for...in`
- Iterates over the **keys (property names)** of an object.  
- Best used when you want to work with object properties.

**Works best in scenarios like:**
1. Looping through the keys of an object to access its values.  
2. Checking which properties exist in an object for validation or debugging.

## `for...of`
- Iterates over the **values** of an iterable (like arrays, strings, sets, maps).  
- **Important:** `for...of` doesn’t work directly on plain objects, because objects aren’t iterable in JavaScript.  
- Best used when you want to directly access the values inside a collection.

**Works best in scenarios like:**
1. Looping through an array to process its elements directly.  
2. Iterating through characters in a string, or values in a Set/Map.
