var myName = 'Nafi'; //we use camel case in JavaScript
let age = 25;

console.log(myName + " " + age);

let personality; //we declared it

console.log(personality); //shows 'undefined' because we have not initialized it yet

const PI = 3.1416;

console.log(PI);

// If you did something like this:

// const PI;
// PI = 3.1416;

// This will not work. The declaration will set the value of PI to 'undefined', and since it's a constant, we can't change it later.
