# When do we use for and when do we use while?

## 1. For Loop
**Use:** When we know exactly how many times the loop should run.  
**Example:** We want to print numbers from 1 to 100. Here we know how many times we gotta run the loop.
**Key point:** Ideal for fixed iterations or when we can count the number of repetitions in advance.

## 2. While Loop
**Use:** When we donâ€™t know in advance how many times the loop will run; it continues as long as a condition is true.
**Example:** Keep asking the user for a password until they enter the correct one.
**Key point:** Ideal for condition-based repetition where the number of iterations is uncertain.
